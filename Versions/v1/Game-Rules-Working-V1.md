# FLIP DUNGEON
## GAME RULES
v.0.1 - ALPHA
This is all the notes and brainstorming for the game including ideas that have been tested or abandoned and why.

## STORY
A flip and write game that uses a deck (or decks) of cards for the randomization mechanism.  Players build a party/adventurer and expore a dungeon for gold, experience and renoun
 
## OBJECTIVE
Each player is an adventurer seeking their fame and fortune in a fantasy land of danger and magic.  Flip cards to improve your skills or adventure in different lands, gaining adventure, future, spirit and renown.

## BASICS
- 1-n players
- 30 mins?
- setup involves each player taking a board and a dry erase pen, shuffling their own standard deck of playing cards, and then one deck is used for the "dungeon"
- play takes place over 3 rounds consisting of 5 turns each
- on a turn, four cards are revealed from the deck, and all players must pick from those cards to perform actions
- they can use their own deck to modify their actions

## GAME TERMS
Game - one full game that consists of three rounds with five turns each
Round - each round consists of five turns
Turn - each turn is one action per player, and one reveal of cards
Action - any legal action a player may take by using symbols on the revealed cards to take an available legal action on a card
Health - visible as hearts on the players board, if they run out they go to purgatory and must pay a penalty to return
Gold - visible as gold icons on the players board
Mana - visible as orbs on the players board, spent to perform magic
XP - visible as stars on the players board, spent to increase skills and as "victory points"
Alignment - how far into virtue or vice the player goes

## Scoring / Winning
- There will be a formula that the player will use to determine their success at the end of the game
- Are there different "point" categories that are added to by different successes
	- See Hadrian's Wall for Example: (renown, piety, valor, discipline)
		- Adventure (exploring/quests - moving on the shared board in different areas)
		- Fortune (treasure - gained by NOT spending on items, and pushing your luck)
		- Spirit (advancement/ piety - gained by advancing your character/gods)
		- Renown (completing set collection of items)
		- Other ideas:  Glory, Wisdom, Honor, Influence, Exploration, Craftmanship, Lore, Reputation
