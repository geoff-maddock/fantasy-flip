i'm working on a board game called FANTASY flip based on HADRIAN'S WALL, FLIP TOWN and ROLLING REALMS. players have a board with their character, resources, abilities and skills that they can update using dry erase markers. there are also adventure boards that represent fantastic locations where all players can interact, again by using dry erase markers, and using their resources, abilities and skills. the main driver of the game are two decks of cards that are standard playing cards, where each card suit and value has some meaning in the game. one deck is the player deck that represents the players ability to improve themselves and take actions. the other deck is the adventure deck, which represents things that all players discover when interacting with the adventure boards, as well as random values for skill checks. i'd like you to conceptualize and design the boards for this game, then come up with a visual that matches the style of boards the game is inspired by
