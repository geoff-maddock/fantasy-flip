generate some prototype images for a tabletop game I am working on. i'd like to create a web app tool that will help me design the player boards for a tabletop game I'm working on that's inspired by fliptown, hadrians wall and rolling realms.
the basic mechanism of the game is that the player will have a set of attributes (values that maintain and might increase with certain actions), a set of resources (things that can be gained and spent for benefits or actions), and then they will draw cards that give them actions and resources based on the draw.
the boards are 2d surfaces that are 6" x 6".  players will follow the rules on the board and mark spaces on the board with a dry erase marker.
the tool should help me prototype the design of the board, including the layout, iconography, text, as well as the main mechanism of the board.
As part of the game there will be several "adventure" boards that all players can take actions on.
Each board will have it's own mechanisms, requirements and scoring opportunities, but reference the same general game elements.
There will be opportunities for adding new adventure boards as expansions as time goes on, and players may choose from a selection of adventure boards to use in any particular game.
Some potential boards:
1) Dungeon. This board represents the player exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, gaining experience, finding treasure and relics.
2) Tower. This board represents a wizards tower where the player encounters various magical energies and traps. The more they explore, the more magic they accrue. At the top they must battle a powerful wizard.
3) Forest. This board represents an enchanted forest. In it they can gather resources that can be collected and used to improve their abilities, heal their character or sell for gold. The more they explore specific areas, they will earn special bonuses. There is a small chance of encountering danger.
4) City. This board involves numerous mini-games (see: Rolling Realms) where players can visit various city establishments to earn bonuses based on the cards they drew or played, plus spending resources, and visiting multiple times.
I've already created an app to help with 1) Dungeon.  I'd like an app that will help with prototyping the game mechanisms of the other boards 2, 3 and 4.
