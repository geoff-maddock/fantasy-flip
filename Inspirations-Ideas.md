# INSPIRATIONS, IDEAS, AND THOUGHTS FOR THE GAME

Generate a set of rules for a table top game inspired by FLIPTOWN, HADRIAN'S WALL and ROLLING REALMS with a fantasy rpg / dungeon crawl type of theme. 
 The game will be playable solo or with multi players.  The main parts of the game will include a player board for each player, adventure boards for each area that
  players can visit, decks of standard playing cards, one for each player and one for adventure, and each player will have a different colored dry erase marker

The main mechanisms of the game are:
- Flipping cards from the player deck, and using the cards to take actions on the player or adventure board
- Flipping cards from the adventure deck to determine what the player encounters, or the difficulty of the encounter
- Activating abilities on the plyer board to take special actions or gain bonuses when interacting with the adventure board
- Spending resources to take actions on the player board or adventure board, or to transform card draws
- Scoring points based on the results of different actions taken
