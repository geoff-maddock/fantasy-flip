# FLIP DUNGEON
## GAME RULES
v.0.1 - ALPHA
This is all the notes and brainstorming for the game including ideas that have been tested or abandoned and why.

## STORY
A flip and write game that uses a deck (or decks) of cards for the randomization mechanism.  Players build a party/adventurer and expore a dungeon for gold, experience and renoun
 
## OBJECTIVE
Each player is an adventurer seeking their fame and fortune in a fantasy land of danger and magic.  Flip cards to improve your skills or adventure in different lands, gaining adventure, future, spirit and renown.

## BASICS
- 1-n players
- 30 mins?
- setup involves each player taking a board and a dry erase pen, shuffling their own standard deck of playing cards, and then one deck is used for the "dungeon"
- play takes place over 3 rounds consisting of 5 turns each
- on a turn, four cards are revealed from the deck, and all players must pick from those cards to perform actions
- they can use their own deck to modify their actions

## GAME TERMS
Game - one full game that consists of three rounds with five turns each
Round - each round consists of five turns
Turn - each turn is one action per player, and one reveal of cards
Action - any legal action a player may take by using symbols on the revealed cards to take an available legal action on a card
Health - visible as hearts on the players board, if they run out they go to purgatory and must pay a penalty to return
Gold - visible as gold icons on the players board
Mana - visible as orbs on the players board, spent to perform magic
XP - visible as stars on the players board, spent to increase skills and as "victory points"
Alignment - how far into virtue or vice the player goes

## Scoring / Winning
- There will be a formula that the player will use to determine their success at the end of the game
- Are there different "point" categories that are added to by different successes
	- See Hadrian's Wall for Example: (renown, piety, valor, discipline)
		- Adventure (exploring/quests - moving on the shared board in different areas)
		- Fortune (treasure - gained by NOT spending on items, and pushing your luck)
		- Spirit (advancement/ piety - gained by advancing your character/gods)
		- Renown (completing set collection of items)
		- Other ideas:  Glory, Wisdom, Honor, Influence, Exploration, Craftmanship, Lore, Reputation

## PARTS & BOARDS

- Sorceror - use mana to achieve magical results

- group into 'good/evil' and 'neutral/good or evil'

## Brainstorming Notes

# 20240326 - Initial ideas

- Make it over the top grim?
	- blood
	- bones
	- souls?
	- most things eaten/destroyed?
- Skins
	- Generic fantasy
	- Over the top grim fantasy
	- Clownbashing
	- Batman vs Joker?


# 20240514
- What do I want the experience to feel like?
	- To some degree, I want the player to feel like they have choices like in an RPG - what direction do they want to go?
	- I would like it to work as a solo game, OR as a multi player game
	- I want the player to feel like their character advances - building stats, skills, items, and renownd
	- I want the player to 
	- I don't want to dillute the game with TOO many choices so that 
- How does scoring work?
- How many turns are there in the game?  
	- Might be limited by the size of the deck?
	- Could we make the deck itself the "hitpoints" or "action points" - the player can choose to spend more cards, but that causes the game to end sooner?
	- A shared "encounter/adventure" deck represents the world that both/all players interact with


#### Brainstorming & Early ideas
Components consist of dice(or some way to provide randomness), a writing utensil, and medium to write on.
Gameplay includes rolling dice and choosing something to write based on the results of the dice.
Popular mechanisms to use within include push your luck and dice mitigation.

Players have a player board
There is a realm board as well - this is where multiple players can also take actions
There is a player deck that represents the player turns
There is an adventure deck that represents things encountered

### Mechanisms to Review

Rolling Realms
file:///Z:/games/boardgames/Rolling%20Realms%20Redux/RRRedux_Compendium_r11.pdf
- A Feast For Odin
	- Tetris shaps to fill sections of board
	- Gain resources for what you cover, and points based on filling zones
	- Could be used for lots of things, but def dungeons

- Architects of the West Kingdom
	- Two choices - marking numbers that must be increasing vs decreasing for rewards
	- Third choice for specific numbers you can trade

- Between Two Castles
	- vertical space of a tower/castle
	- numbers must go low to high
	- score points for rows, resources for columns

- Player deck of cards
	- One Deck
	- Two Decks
	- Differentiated Color
	- Limited to one player, except in some cases in multi-player, cards can be stolen or manipulated

- Adventure deck of cards
	- One Deck
	- Two Decks
	- Differentiated Color
	- Shared by all players
	- Mostly just work on adventure boards, except in some cases where they can act on a player board

- Player Boards
	- The invidual player's boards where their character is defined
	- Stats - abilities that increase with development
	- Resources - items or materials that can be expended 
	- Abilities - tokens or keywords that allow the player certain action or access
	- Virtues - a di-pole rating that defines players penalty, bonus or access to certain things, but can change
	- Scoring - measures the players success in different areas gained by completing quests, collecting items, visiting locations, etc.  typically only goes up

- Grid on a player board:  Draw a sigil, house, magic, herald, religion.  Based on size and number of shapes, gain different bonuses
- Inspiration for maps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-WOSGi2je8
- create a set of "action" icons that are recognizable across boards.  different player abilities will modify these action types:  ex: gather, fight, research, disarm, craft, enchant, and prevent having to write out long descriptions on a board.
    - the explanations will be in a manual or quick rules helper sheet
